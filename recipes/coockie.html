        <h3>Method:</h3
            <ol> <h4>Step 1:</h4>
                <li>Heat the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5.</li>
                <li>Cream the butter in a large bowl with a wooden spoon or in a stand mixer until it is soft.</li>
                <li>Add the sugar and keep beating until the mixture is light and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Sift in the flour and add the optional ingredients, if you’re using them.</li>
                <li>Bring the mixture together with your hands in a figure-of-eight motion until it forms a dough.</li>
                <p>You can freeze the dough at this point.</p>
                
                <h4>Step 2:</h4>
                <li>Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and place them slightly apart from each other on a baking sheet (you don’t need to butter or line it)</li>
                <li>Flatten the balls a little with the palm of your hand and bake them in the oven for around 10-12 mins until they are golden brown and slightly firm on top. </li>
                <li>Leave the cookies on a cooling rack for around 15 mins before serving.</li>
                
            </ol>
